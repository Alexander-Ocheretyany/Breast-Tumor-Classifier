# Breast tumor classifier based on a feed-forward neural network

The course project for "Neural Networks" course at Charles university.

The aim of the project is to build a breast tumor classifier that successfuly classifies breast tumors as benign
or malignant based on digitized images of breast tumor tissue obtained during fine-needle aspiration.

As a result, we managed to create a quite competitive classifier with 98.9% accuracy that outperforms many other classifiers.
